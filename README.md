## 📚 Dataset

This bot uses a cleaned version of the [Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html) where:
- Each input line is paired with a response
- Stored in a simple CSV format

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

- User types a message
- Bot searches for an exact or similar match in the dataset
- It returns a random response, or a default fallback reply if no match is found

---

## 🧪 Local Run Instructions

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pandas gradio
```
# Run the chatbot
```
python app.py
```
